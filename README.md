## Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to better identify which charitites will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. This will be done by building a machine learning model and identifying which variables have the most predicitve power.

# Results

*Data Preprocessing*

- The target variable in this model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL", a binary flag that shows if the organization was sucessful in its goals.
- The feature variables of this model are "APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFLIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "STATUS", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", "ASK_AMT"
- In order to improve the accuracy of the model some variables were removed, including "EIN" and "NAME".

Thus, after data cleaning, the dataset looked like the below:




*Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model*


How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
